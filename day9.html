        <p>In India, packaged food products must be labeled with a symbol to indicate if they are vegetarian or non-vegetarian. Vegetarian food is labeled with a green symbol, while non-vegetarian food is labeled with a brown symbol. In 2020, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) changed the non-vegetarian symbol from a brown circle to a brown triangle to help people who are color blind. The symbol is a brown triangle inside a square with a brown outline, and the sides and diameter must be at least the minimum size specified. If the food only contains eggs as a non-vegetarian ingredient, the manufacturer can also include a declaration to that>

 <section style="background-color: darksalmon;"><u>ABOUT FOOD DETAILS AND PICS</u><p>In France, school canteens must offer a vegetarian meal at least once per week. The objective was to evaluate the nutritional quality of school main dishes. A database of main dishes served in primary schools was first split into non-vegetarian (n = 669) and vegetarian (n = 315) categories. The latter has been divided into three sub-categories: vegetarian dishes containing cheese, vegetarian dishes containing eggs and/or dairy products but no cheese and vegetarian dishes without any eggs, cheese or other dairy products (vegan). Categories and sub-categories were compared based on nutrient adequacy ratios for “protective” nutrients (proteins, fibres, vitamins, minerals, essential fatty acids), the contents of nutrients to be limited (saturated fatty acids (SFA), sodium, free sugars) and on two nutrient profiling systems (SAIN,LIM and Nutri-Score).>
